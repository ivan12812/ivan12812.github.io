        <h3>COMPANY PROFILE</h3>
        <p class="profile">PT Astra Honda Motor (AHM) is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Indonesia. The company was initially established under the name PT Federal Motor on June 11, 1971, with majority ownership by PT Astra International. <br/><br/>
 
        In its early years, the company imported motorcycle components from Japan in completely knocked down (CKD) form. The first product assembled by the company was a business type, the S 90 Z, a 4-stroke motorcycle with a 90cc capacity. The company's products were well-received by consumers, with the first type launching 1,500 units into the market. Demand surged dramatically to 30,000 units the following year.<br/><br/>
             
        In 2001, PT Federal Motor began producing various Honda motorcycle components itself in response to Indonesian government policies on automotive component localization. The company started producing automotive components through its subsidiaries. It began by establishing a subsidiary that manufactured basic components such as frames, wheels, exhaust pipes, and others under the label PT Honda Federal in 1974. Five years later, the company founded PT Showa Manufacturing Indonesia, which specializes in shock absorber production.<br/><br/>
             
        Subsequently, in 1984, PT Honda Astra Engine Manufacturing was established to produce motorcycle engines.<br/><br/>
             
        In 1990, the company continued to expand its component production by re-establishing a subsidiary named PT Federal Izumi Mfg. This subsidiary specializes in piston production.</p><hr><br><br>
